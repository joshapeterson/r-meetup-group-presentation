# Design Process

Validate
```{r eval=FALSE}
output$motivation_wordcloud <- renderPlot({
        validate(
                need(motivation_freq()$n != "", "No Data Available")
        )
```

# Future Work

--

1. Improve UI and visualizations for improved usability
  - Download buttons for tables
  - Improve reactivitity of plots and tables to filtering
  - Improve performance of application (caching of plots, analyze performance via shinyloadtest, etc.)

--

1. Provide more analysis around potential biases and gaps
  - Better comparisons among groups of interest
  - Utilize statistical tests to potentially find evidence of bias 
  
--

1. Provide more support for insights
  - More descriptive language to help with interpretation
  - Provide more information concerning sample sizes, number of observations, etc.
